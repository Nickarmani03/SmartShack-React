Welcome to SmartShack, a React based app, that is used to track smart devices around your home. this app is extremely useful for  anyone who would want to use it to track their smart devices int hier home from anywhere. I wanted to create this app due to a real world issue I have when adding new smart devices to my home. I noticed theres no way to track my smart devices and findout where in my home they were located without going into my router settings to find the device information or going and phisically locationg the devices around my home. The SmartShack app allows the members in the home to easily sign up for the app and begin using the app to track devices that have been added. This app helps household family members (users) keep track of all their smart devices, whether they have IOS or Android, in one place. 

Keeps all their devices listed cleanly and automatically when added to the home by where they device is located by allowing the user to add them to a room.

Keeps all their devices listed cleanly and by the room.

Allows the user to create a profile and log in.

A user can also add more users if needed.

Allows a user to add a room.

Allows a user to add new devices.

Allows the customer to delete a smart device when its no longer needed.

Allows the user to  edit the device and change the the room where the device is listed if the device is moved.

User can log out when completed.

Technologies used:
Javascript / HTML / CSS / React

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
